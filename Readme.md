## 2. Team Members: 
Abigail Vasquez (Team Lead), Gloria Hagin (Tester), Matt Shuff (Data Engineer), Jasmine Lo (Scrum Master)

## 3. Project Description/Outline: 
Determining the factors that have the largest impact on graduation rates in Texas school districts. The factors we will be exploring are median household income, SAT scores, and community type to find which has the greatest correlation with whether or not a student will complete high school.

## 4. Research Questions to Answer: 
Which factors seem to have higher correlation to high school graduation rates?
Household income? SAT/ACT? Community type (e.g., rural, urban, suburban, etc.)

What is the average graduation rate of each city/county?

## 5. Data sources or Data Sets to be Used:
Income per county: http://www.txcip.org/tac/census/morecountyinfo.php?MORE=1013

Texas city latitude and longitude data: https://www.gaslampmedia.com/download-zip-code-latitude-longitude-city-state-county-csv/

SAT Score by District: https://tea.texas.gov/acctres/sat_act_index.html

Disctrict Information: https://tea.texas.gov/acctres/completion/2016/level.html

## 6. Rough Breakdown of Tasks
Collect and compile all data and put into a database (e.g., MySQL)

Create visualizations (with Javascript, HTML/CSS, Leaflet, Plotly etc.) to illustrate different factors that may correlate with graduation rates

Display the data through a dashboard page with multiple charts and create a Flask App
